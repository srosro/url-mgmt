===Notes:
* Steps 1-10 are only required for setup.
* When there are new dependencies simply: "pip install -E orchard -r ./requirements.txt"
* Much of this is cribbed from http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2009/05/notes-using-pip-and-virtualenv-django/
* To install a package to the virtual environment: pip install -E orchard packagename
* To freeze the environment to requirements.txt: pip freeze -E orchard > requirements.txt

=== 1.  Install gfortran
Assuming you have Xcode 3.2.3 or higher and Snow Leopard, install this: http://r.research.att.com/gfortran-42-5664.pkg.
If you have Lion with Xcode 4.1 install this: http://r.research.att.com/gfortran-lion-5666-3.pkg


=== 2. Go to env/
# cd /path/to/freshplum/env/


=== 3. Make sure python 2.7 is installed:
# python --version
Python 2.7.2

Note: python2.7-dev is required to compile some of the binaries below.


=== 4. Make sure pip is installed:
# pip --version
pip 1.0.2 from /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip-1.0.2-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)

Note python version number.  If that doesn't work try this and run again:
# sudo easy_install-2.7 -U pip


=== 5. Make sure /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/ (or similar) is in your path
If you've installed pip or virtualenv and can't run it then this is probably the problem.
Solution: vim ~/.profile and add folder to $PATH variable (colon delimited).


=== 6. Make sure virtualenv is installed:
# virtualenv --version
1.6.1

If that doesn't work install it:
# sudo pip install virtualenv


=== 7. Make sure mysql_config is installed:
# mysql_config --version
5.1.57

If you're using macports you may have to symlink it:
# sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/mysql_config5 /opt/local/bin/mysql_config

If you didn't install mysql from macports you'll need to install libmysqlclient-dev


=== 8. Initalize virtual environment:
# virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute orchard


=== 9. Install dependencies
# pip install -E orchard -r ./requirements.txt


=== 10. Install scipy
# pip install -E orchard -r ./scipy_requirement.txt


=== 11. Activate & use django
# source orchard/bin/activate
# cd ../plum
# python manage.py runserver


=== 12. Deactivate when done
# deactivate
